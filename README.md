#Description      
                                                            
In this project we want to change the backgroundcolor of button based on boolean variable, if it is true then add button background color as red, if it variable is false the add button background color as blue.

#Algorithm                                                                                                                                                          
1. First we assign value of "select" const to "true".                                                                 
2. Then we change background colour of button based on this boolean data.   
3. Then in conditional operator we check, whether value of "select" is true or false.
4. If true green , or else red
