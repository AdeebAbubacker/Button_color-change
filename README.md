In this project we want to change the backgroundcolor of button based on boolean variable, if it is true then add button background color as red, if it variable is false the add button background color as blue.

#Algorithm                                                                                                                                                          
1. First we save value of cendol variable to 2.                                                                 
2. Then we pass 2 values as props cendol and setCendol.                                                            
3. So setCendol is the function to update the cendol variable.                                                                     
4. So now, we can update cendol variable by 10.
